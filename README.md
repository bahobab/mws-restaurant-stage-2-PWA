#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 2

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

Specification
You will be provided code for a Node development server and a README for getting the server up and running locally on your computer. The README will also contain the API you will need to make JSON requests to the server. Once you have the server up, you will begin the work of improving your Stage One project code.

The core functionality of the application will not change for this stage. Only the source of the data will change. You will use the fetch() API to make requests to the server to populate the content of your Restaurant Reviews app.

Requirements
Use server data instead of local memory In the first version of the application, all of the data for the restaurants was stored in the local application. You will need to change this behavior so that you are pulling all of your data from the server instead, and using the response data to generate the restaurant information on the main page and the detail page.

Use IndexedDB to cache JSON responses In order to maintain offline use with the development server you will need to update the service worker to store the JSON received by your requests using the IndexedDB API. As with Stage One, any page that has been visited by the user should be available offline, with data pulled from the shell database.

Meet the minimum performance requirements Once you have your app working with the server and working in offline mode, you’ll need to measure your site performance using Lighthouse.

Lighthouse measures performance in four areas, but your review will focus on three:

Progressive Web App score should be at 90 or better.
Performance score should be at 70 or better.
Accessibility score should be at 90 or better.
You can audit your site's performance with Lighthouse by using the Audit tab of Chrome Dev Tools. 

### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and make start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
